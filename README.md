# Free Analysis!

Welcome! Here is the sandbox where I fine-tune my data-wrangling / modeling / analysis chops. Most of these subjects will find their way onto my blog, [optimaldigression](https://www.optimaldigression.com) , but you can check out the raw source & keep tabs on development here.

Most data is from the fantastic RforDataScience project [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), with a bit of other sources pulled in to help build the story as I see fit.

Thanks for checking it out!
